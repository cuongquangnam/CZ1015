This is for project of this course

2019.4.5
remark from WS:
    I have filled in the values for the variables but I am still trying to build another model to predict the life ladder besides using linear regression and I want to try to use cross validation to improve our accuracy.

2019.4.6
remark from WS:
    I have added in a RandomForestregressor model and I am left with prediction of life ladder for 2019.
    
    I finished the prediction for 2019 but the results for different models looks a bit weird, i thought model 2 would have higher score       than model 1 but OOPS
    
    And btw I've found another cool regression model so I'll probably add another one later if i have time
