This is for project of this course

2019.4.5
remark from WS:
    I have filled in the values for the variables but I am still trying to build another model to predict the life ladder besides using linear regression and I want to try to use cross validation to improve our accuracy.

2019.4.6
remark from WS:
    I have added in a RandomForestregressor model and I am left with prediction of life ladder for 2019.
    
    I finished the prediction for 2019 but the results for different models looks a bit weird, i thought model 2 would have higher score       than model 1 but OOPS
    
    And btw I've found another cool regression model so I'll probably add another one later if i have time

2019.4.7
remark from WS:
    OMG I'm done with regression finally yay!
    I changed some codes after clarifying some of my doubts with a senior. Turns out that CV is used to estimate the fitness of the model rather than to generate datasets lol.
    And I've done the prediction of Life ladder for the year 2018 (also just realised today that it's not 2019...)
